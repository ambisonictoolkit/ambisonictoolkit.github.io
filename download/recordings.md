<h2>Installing example files for SuperCollider</h2>

<p>For full featured Help examples in SuperCollider, ATK example sound files are required. Install the ATK <a href="/download/supercollider">as described</a>, then download example files found on this page.</p>

<p>Launch SuperCollider3 and run the following code:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
Soundfile examples
(
// Place unzipped kernels in the directory opened
// Presume Atk.userSupportDir has already been created

Atk.openUserSupportDir;
)
</pre>

<p>If the ATK has been correctly installed, the above code will open the ATK's user support directory. Place the downloaded sound file here.</p>
