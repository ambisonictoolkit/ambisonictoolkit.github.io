ATK for SuperCollider3 v.3.7.2 release is now available for download. But you
probably already know! As part of the
[sc3-plugins](https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins) project, we had this
[new release](https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins/releases) 14 days
ago. That's why you already knew. Why'd we wait until now to speak up? A few
things.

First off, the accompanying README now includes a
[List of Changes](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-sc3#list-of-changes).
We'd like to be much more official about keeping you up to date with
what's happening with the ATK. The updates to the README help us do that. Much
easier than filtering through the
[Commits](https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins/commits/master) to
[sc3-plugins](https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins) trying to spot ATK
improvements.

Aside from some documentation updates related to the recent web hosting move,
the addition of _Ambisonic exchange_ encoding & decoding will be of interest.
Particularly if you're one of the VR crowd. First order exchange to & from
these encodings is now supported:

*  ACN-N3D, ACN-SN3D

As a result, you can now incorporate your ATK work with evolving VR standards.
Google's
[JumpVR Spatial Audio](https://support.google.com/jump/answer/6399746?hl=en)
uses ACN-SN3D encoding, aka AmbiX. The
[ZoomH2n](https://www.zoom.co.jp/products/handy-recorder/h2n-handy-recorder)
recorder also now supports ACN-SN3D via a
[firmware update](https://www.zoom.co.jp/H2n-update-v2). Cool.

As you'd expect, we also hope you take advantage of the ATK Kernels v.1.2.1
release. (Of course you've already
[read about it](http://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/releases/2016/06/17/atk-kernels-1.2.1.html)!)
Among other things, you'll get the measured binaural decoders
([CIPIC](http://interface.cipic.ucdavis.edu/sound/hrtf.html) &
[Listen](http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/salles/listen/)) at 48000Hz. VR folks
love that!
