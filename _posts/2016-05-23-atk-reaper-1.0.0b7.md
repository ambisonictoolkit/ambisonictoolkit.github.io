ATK for Reaper v.1.0.0 beta 7 is now available for download. This version improves the graphical user interfaces for a number of decorders. It introduce  monitoring of decoded sound levels for a number of decoders: Stereo, Quadrophonic, 5_0, Pantophonic 2D and Periphonic 3D. Additionally it displays the channel configuration for these plugins, making it easier to get channel routing right. The new Periphonic 3D decoder decodes to two rings of speakers.

The new version can be downloaded [here](/download/reaper/).

These additions are the outcome of a short-term residency and workshop that Trond Lossius had at [SCRIME](http://scrime.labri.fr/) in Bordeaux last week. The GUIs for the decoders are inspired by user interfaces from [HOALibrary for Max](https://github.com/CICM/HoaLibrary-Max). Peak level metering is based on code by [Phil Burke](http://musicdsp.org/showArchiveComment.php?ArchiveID=19).
